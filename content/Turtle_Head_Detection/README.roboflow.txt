The dataset includes 316 images.
Objects are annotated in COCO Segmentation format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
